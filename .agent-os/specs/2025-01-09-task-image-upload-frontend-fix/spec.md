> Spec: Task Image Upload Frontend Fix
> Created: 2025-01-09

## Overview

Fix critical frontend issues with task image upload system where file picker uploads don't work, images keep refreshing constantly, and image preview functionality is broken. Additionally, verify that images are being properly added and deleted in the database to ensure complete end-to-end functionality. The backend is confirmed working correctly based on terminal logs showing successful image serving.

## User Stories

### File Picker Upload Fix

As a user, I want to be able to click the upload area and select files from my device, so that I can upload images to tasks without being limited to only drag and drop functionality.

**Detailed Workflow**: User clicks on the upload area, file picker opens, user selects one or more image files, files are uploaded with progress indication, and images appear in the task card.

### Stable Image Display

As a user, I want uploaded images to display consistently without constantly refreshing or reloading, so that I can view task reference images without visual disruption.

**Detailed Workflow**: After upload completion, images load once and remain stable in the task card, showing proper thumbnails without flickering or reloading.

### Enhanced Image Preview

As a user, I want to click on uploaded images to view them in a full-screen preview with professional UI/UX, so that I can examine task reference images in detail.

**Detailed Workflow**: User clicks on any uploaded image thumbnail, a professional modal opens with the full-size image, user can close the modal by clicking outside or pressing ESC.

### Database Integrity Verification

As a system administrator, I want to verify that image uploads and deletions are properly recorded in the database, so that I can ensure data integrity and troubleshoot any issues with the image management system.

**Detailed Workflow**: After each upload or deletion operation, verify that the `task_attachments` table is updated correctly, file records are created/deleted, and the task's `referenceImages` are properly synchronized with the database state.

## Spec Scope

1. **File Picker Upload Fix** - Ensure click-to-upload functionality works alongside drag & drop
2. **Image Caching System** - Implement proper image caching to prevent constant refreshing
3. **Enhanced Preview Modal** - Create professional full-screen image preview with modern UI/UX
4. **Upload Progress Tracking** - Add visual progress indicators for file picker uploads
5. **Error State Management** - Improve error handling and user feedback for failed uploads
6. **Database Integrity Verification** - Verify that image uploads and deletions are properly recorded in the database

## Out of Scope

- Backend API changes (confirmed working correctly)
- Database schema modifications
- Authentication system changes
- Mobile-specific optimizations (will be addressed in future iteration)

## Expected Deliverable

1. File picker upload works correctly with visual progress feedback
2. Images display stably without constant refreshing or reloading
3. Professional image preview modal with enhanced UI/UX opens when clicking thumbnails
4. Upload progress is clearly visible for both drag & drop and file picker methods
5. Error states are properly handled with clear user feedback
6. Database integrity is verified - images are properly added and deleted in the `task_attachments` table
