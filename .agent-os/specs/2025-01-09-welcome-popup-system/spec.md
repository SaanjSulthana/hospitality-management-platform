Implement a comprehensive welcome popup system that provides personalized greetings, real-time dashboard insights, and actionable guidance for users. The popup should appear after successful login, be centered and eye-catching, and adapt based on user role and property setup status.

## User Stories

### Personalized Welcome Experience

As a user, I want to see a personalized welcome popup after logging in, so that I feel welcomed and can quickly understand what's important for my day.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Display personalized greeting with user's name and role
- Show current time and date context
- Present 2-3 most important items for the day
- Include real-time data from dashboard
- Provide quick action buttons for immediate tasks
- Allow easy dismissal with close button

### New User Onboarding

As a new user who hasn't created any properties, I want the welcome popup to serve as a quick action guide, so that I can get started with the platform immediately.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Show prominent "Get Started" section
- Display step-by-step onboarding actions
- Provide direct links to create first property
- Include helpful tips and guidance
- Show progress indicators for setup completion

### Role-Based Content

As an Admin or Manager, I want to see different welcome content based on my role, so that I see relevant information and actions for my responsibilities.
