# Spec Summary (Lite)

Fix Encore's static file serving to properly serve frontend content instead of returning empty responses. The backend API is fully functional, but the frontend returns `RawContentLength: 0` despite files being present and correctly built. Need to diagnose and implement a working `api.static` configuration that serves the complete frontend application with all assets accessible.
