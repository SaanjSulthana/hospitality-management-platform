> Spec: Frontend Deployment Fix
> Created: 2025-01-10

## Overview

Fix the frontend deployment issue where Encore's static file serving returns empty content (RawContentLength: 0) despite files being present and correctly built. The backend API is fully functional, but the frontend is not being served properly through Encore's `api.static` configuration.

## User Stories

### Frontend Access
As a user, I want to access the frontend application through the Encore Cloud URL, so that I can use the complete hospitality management platform with both backend API and frontend interface working together.

The frontend should load completely with all assets (HTML, CSS, JS) being served correctly through Encore's static file serving mechanism.

### Static Asset Serving
As a developer, I want the frontend static assets to be served correctly through Encore's `api.static` configuration, so that the application works as intended in the Encore Cloud environment.

All frontend files should be accessible and served with proper content length and MIME types.

## Spec Scope

1. **Diagnose Static File Serving Issue** - Identify why Encore's `api.static` returns empty content despite files being present
2. **Implement Working Static File Configuration** - Configure Encore to properly serve frontend static files
3. **Verify Frontend Functionality** - Ensure the complete frontend application loads and functions correctly
4. **Test Encore Cloud Deployment** - Confirm the fix works in the Encore Cloud environment

## Out of Scope

- Backend API modifications (already working)
- Database changes (already working)
- Frontend build process changes (already working)
- Authentication system changes (already working)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Frontend application loads completely at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` with proper content
2. All static assets (CSS, JS, images) are served with correct content length > 0
3. Frontend application is fully functional and accessible through Encore Cloud URLs
4. No more `RawContentLength: 0` errors when accessing the frontend
