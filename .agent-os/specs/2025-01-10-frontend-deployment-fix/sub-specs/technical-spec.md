# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-01-10-frontend-deployment-fix/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Diagnose Encore Static File Serving**: Investigate why `api.static` returns empty content despite files being present in `backend/dist/`
- **Verify File Path Resolution**: Ensure Encore can correctly resolve paths to static files in the `dist` directory
- **Test Different Static Configurations**: Try various `api.static` configurations including different path patterns, directory references, and fallback options
- **Implement Alternative Serving Method**: If `api.static` continues to fail, implement a custom API endpoint to serve static files
- **Verify Content-Type Headers**: Ensure proper MIME types are set for different file types (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- **Test Asset Loading**: Verify that all frontend assets load correctly including CSS, JavaScript, and images
- **Validate Encore Cloud Compatibility**: Ensure the solution works in both local development and Encore Cloud environments

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies are required for this fix. The solution will use existing Encore APIs and file system operations.
