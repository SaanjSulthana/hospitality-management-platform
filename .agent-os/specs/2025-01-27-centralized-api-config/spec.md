> Spec: Centralized API Configuration
> Created: 2025-01-27

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive centralized API configuration system that eliminates hardcoded URLs in the frontend, standardizes API call patterns, and provides consistent environment management while respecting the existing Encore.js backend architecture.

## User Stories

### Backend Configuration Enhancement

As a backend developer, I want to enhance the existing Encore.js configuration system with centralized environment management and configuration validation, so that I can easily manage different environments while maintaining the framework's benefits.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Enhance existing Encore.js service configuration with environment-aware settings
- Add centralized configuration validation and health checks
- Implement consistent error handling and logging across all services
- Maintain Encore.js database connection patterns while adding configuration utilities

### Frontend API Integration

As a frontend developer, I want all API calls to use centralized configuration, so that I can easily switch between development, staging, and production environments without code changes.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- All API calls use centralized base URL configuration
- Environment variables are properly managed for different deployment scenarios
- Error handling and retry policies are consistent across all API calls
- Debug and logging configurations are centrally controlled

### DevOps Environment Management

As a DevOps engineer, I want environment-specific configurations to be easily manageable, so that I can deploy the application to different environments without manual configuration changes.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Environment variables are properly configured for each deployment
- Database connections automatically adapt to environment
- API endpoints are correctly configured for each environment
- Debug and logging levels are environment-appropriate

## Spec Scope

1. **Frontend API Configuration Completion** - Complete the centralization of all hardcoded URLs in frontend components and standardize API call patterns
2. **Backend Configuration Enhancement** - Add centralized environment management and configuration validation utilities while respecting Encore.js patterns
3. **Environment Management System** - Implement robust environment detection and configuration management for both frontend and backend
4. **API Call Standardization** - Standardize all API call patterns, error handling, and retry policies across the frontend
5. **Configuration Validation and Testing** - Add validation and testing utilities for configuration management

## Out of Scope

- Changing the existing Encore.js framework architecture or database connection patterns
- Modifying existing API endpoint structures or service definitions
- Changing database schemas or table structures
- Implementing new authentication mechanisms
- Adding new API endpoints or services
- Replacing Encore.js service configuration patterns

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete frontend API configuration system that eliminates all hardcoded URLs and standardizes API call patterns
2. Enhanced backend configuration utilities that work with Encore.js while providing centralized environment management
3. Comprehensive testing and validation utilities for configuration management across all environments
