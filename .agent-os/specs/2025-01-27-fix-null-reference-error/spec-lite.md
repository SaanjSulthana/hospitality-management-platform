# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement comprehensive null safety and error handling for transaction data loading to eliminate the intermittent "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'reports')" error. Add safe data access patterns with optional chaining, comprehensive error handling with retry logic, and proper loading states to prevent race conditions and ensure the app remains functional even when API calls fail.
