# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a comprehensive guest check-in system allowing Indian and foreign guests to self-check-in at properties with admin oversight. The system provides tailored check-in forms based on guest nationality, collects appropriate identification and compliance information, and offers administrators a centralized dashboard for real-time guest management. This streamlines the check-in process, reduces front desk workload, and ensures regulatory compliance.
