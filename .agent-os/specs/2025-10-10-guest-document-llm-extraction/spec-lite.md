# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement intelligent document processing for guest check-ins using LLM-based OCR (GPT-4 Vision) to automatically extract and auto-fill guest information from uploaded ID documents (Aadhaar, passport, visa, PAN cards). Store document images securely in the database with comprehensive audit logging that tracks all admin and manager actions (view, update, checkout, document access) on guest records with timestamps and user identification for compliance and accountability.
