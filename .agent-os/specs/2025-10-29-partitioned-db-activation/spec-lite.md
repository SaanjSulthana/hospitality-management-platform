# Spec Summary (Lite)

Activate the partitioned Postgres schema, supporting repositories, and observability so finance/reporting traffic uses `_partitioned` tables safely. Harden triggers, refactor services through partition-aware repositories, deploy Redis/replicas, and ship rollout metrics + rollback docs to support 1M-organization scale.
