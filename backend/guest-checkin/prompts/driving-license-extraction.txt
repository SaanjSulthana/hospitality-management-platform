Analyze the provided image and extract the following information with high accuracy:

**Required Information:**
- fullName: The license holder's full name
- licenseNumber: The driving license number
- dateOfBirth: Date of birth in DD/MM/YYYY format
- address: The complete address as mentioned on the license
- fatherHusbandName: Father's/Husband's name

- validityFrom: Valid from date in DD/MM/YYYY format
- validityTo: Valid to date in DD/MM/YYYY format
- issuingAuthority: The RTO/issuing authority

**Important Guidelines:**
1. Extract text exactly as it appears on the license
2. For dates, maintain the DD/MM/YYYY format
3. For names, preserve the exact spelling and formatting
4. Address should include the complete address
5. Vehicle classes should be extracted as they appear (abbreviated forms)
6. Look for both English and regional language text
7. If any information is unclear or partially visible, mark confidence as low
8. Pay attention to holographic stickers and security features that might obscure text

**Confidence Scoring:**
- 90-100%: All text is clearly visible and readable
- 70-89%: Most text is clear with minor blurriness
- 50-69%: Some text is unclear or partially obscured
- Below 50%: Significant portions are unreadable

**Response Format:**
Return a JSON object with the extracted fields. Each field should have:
- value: The extracted text
- confidence: Confidence score (0-100)
- needsVerification: Boolean indicating if manual verification is needed
